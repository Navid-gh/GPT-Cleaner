# Privacy Policy for GPT Cleaner

**Last Updated: February 21, 2026**

GPT Cleaner ("the extension") is an open-source tool designed to optimize the performance of the ChatGPT web application. Your privacy is a priority, and this policy outlines our data practices.

## 1. Data Collection

**GPT Cleaner does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information.**

- We do not have access to your chat history.
- We do not track your activity on ChatGPT.
- We do not use any tracking pixels, analytics, or external APIs.

## 2. Local Storage

The extension uses the `chrome.storage.sync` API for one purpose only:

- To save your local preferences (e.g., whether the extension is enabled and your preferred "Visible Message Count").
  This data stays within your Google Chrome profile and is never shared with the developer or any third parties.

## 3. Communication

The extension operates entirely locally within your browser. No data ever leaves your device.

## 4. Open Source

The source code is publicly available on GitHub for audit and transparency.

## 5. Contact

If you have any questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
